Aletheia

A blockchain of evidence for digital media, facilitating certainty in the post-truth media age.

Deepfakes. Lyrebird. AI-Enhanced digital Editing. How can we be sure that the media we are looking at is a 
true representation of real events?

In the Post-Factual political climate of 2019, these questions are becoming more relevant 
than ever. With democracy and even the fate of humanity in the balance, how can we make informed
decisions if we can't trust the information we are given?

Aletheia seeks to provide a toolset to guage the authenticity of media events by using 
spatiotemporal sensory consensus algorythims to measure the certainty that an  event 
was recorded as reported and not tampered with or modified in any way.

With Aletheia, people will have a transparent, immutable solution with which to quickly guage 
the provenance of a digital artifact. A rating of sureity can be generated, and published with a 
code verifyable on the blockchain, even if the article is transposed or transcoded to different media.

In addition, the Aletheia toolset aloows:

Granular and distributed monetization of the verification process to incentivise verification nodes.

Monetizatiion of digital artifacts in an on-chain  marketplace protocol

Opt-in monetization of demographic, network, and location data, verified by the Aletheia network to provent 
bot-fraud and other forms of "data farming".

Opt-in witness discovery for tort, evidenciary, or commercial purposes - Verified and monetized on-chain to 
reduce witness bias and verify testimonial statements

...as well as many more potential use cases.
