Aletheia

Deepfakes. Lyrebird. AI-Enhanced digital Editing. How can we be sure that the media we are looking at is a true representation of real events?

In the Post-Factual political climate of 2019 and beyond, these questions are becoming more relevant than ever. With democracy and even the fate of humanity in the balance, how can we make informed decisions if we can't trust the information we are given?

Aletheia will be aÂ blockchain record of evidence for digital media, facilitating certainty in the post-truth media age.

While the blockchain can't say that a recorded event wasnt staged IRL, Aletheia will be able to attest with a determinate degree of certainty (or uncertanty) that a given digital artifact was recorded/signed/created at a certain time and place, and that the data remains unadulterated. This will be accomplished through the Aletheia incentivised consensus protocol.

Aletheia seeks to provide a toolset to gauge the authenticity of media events by using spatiotemporal sensory consensus algorithms to measure the certainty that an event was recorded as reported and not tampered with or modified in any way.

With Aletheia, people will have a transparent, immutable solution with which to quickly gauge the provenance of a digital artifact. A rating of surety can be generated, and published with a code verifiable on the blockchain, even if the article is transposed or transcoded to different media.

In addition, the Aletheia toolset allows:

Granular and distributed monetization of the verification process to incentivise verification nodes.

Monetizatiion of digital artifacts in an on-chain  marketplace protocol

Opt-in monetization of demographic, network, and location data, verified by the Aletheia network to provent 
bot-fraud and other forms of "data farming".

Opt-in witness discovery for tort, evidenciary, or commercial purposes - Verified and monetized on-chain to 
reduce witness bias and verify testimonial statements

...as well as many more potential use cases.
